 <h2>Hi there!</h2>
<p>Thank you for checking out my portofolio. My journey was a bumpy one. I was not driven to specialise in web development as a kid like may others do. My aim was rather shallow for others. I want to retire my parents, they really worked hard to keep  us in high school  even if they could not keep us at uni.  Nevertheless, I am grateful to God because He never let us down. Here are some of my projects.<br>P.S. The images are the links to my projects.Thx</p>
